El Nido’s exotic turquoise lagoons and jagged limestone rocks are way too unique and beautiful to miss, and the photo ops here are limitless. It’s rare that you’ll see this place missing from a travel blog or a list of the best islands in the world, and rightfully so. All of the beaches and island hopping tours in El Nido Palawan are top notch.</p></div></div><div class = "blog-item my-2 shadow"><div class = "blog-item-top"><img src = "images/blog-2.jpg" alt = "blog"><span class = "blog-date">oct 28, 2021</span></div><div class = "blog-item-bottom"><span>travel | john doe</span><a href = "#">Petra Jordan Travel Guide: How To Visit The Lost City</a><p class = "text">The lost city of Petra Jordan is one of the best places to visit in the Middle East. It’s relatively safe and affordable, and there are some amazing things to see. Petra is an incredible ancient city carved into the rocks in southern Jordan, and the ruins can be explored by walking on foot or riding a camel. You could easily spend one or two days here at least. It’s a bucket list item for sure, and this travel blog will explain how you can visit Petra yourself, with or without a tour, and with a modest budget and minimal planning.

Some of the best things to do in Oahu Hawaii include hikes, beaches, waterfalls, botanical gardens, water sports, wildlife sightings, and more. There are also some less conventional things to do in Oahu island, like seeing lighthouses, visiting the Pear Harbor memorial, or touring the Jurassic Park film site. I’ve been privileged to visit the Hawaiian islands many times (often for months at a time), so I’ve done a bunch of hiking, exploring, and sightseeing all over Oahu, including some of the most far flung corners of the island.</p></div></div><div class = "blog-item my-2 shadow"><div class = "blog-item-top"><img src = "images/blog-4.jpg" alt = "blog"><span class = "blog-date">oct 28, 2021</span></div><div class = "blog-item-bottom"><span>travel | johny</span><a href = "#">Komodo Islands Travel Guide For Indonesia</a><p class = "text">The island of Komodo, in Indonesia, is famous for being home to the beastly Komodo dragons (the world’s biggest lizard), and it’s also an incredibly scenic place with lots of other ‘bucket list’ travel experiences. Komodo National Park is UNESCO designated, with dozens of exotic islands, white and pink sand beaches, coral reefs for diving, and it’s the only place in the world where you can see Komodo dragons up close in the wild and get your picture taken with them! Since Indonesia is my second home, I’ve visited the Komodo islands a bunch of times over the years and it’s always a thrill. One of the great things about the gateway town, Labuan Bajo, is that it’s not far from Bali and it’s easy to reach with a short flight from there.</p></div></div><div class = "blog-item my-2 shadow"><div class = "blog-item-top"><img src = "images/blog-5.jpg" alt = "blog"><span class = "blog-date">oct 28, 2021</span></div><div class = "blog-item-bottom"><span>travel | Stony</span><a href = "#">Angkor Wat Travel Guide For Cambodia</a><p class = "text">No traveler’s bucket list would be complete without a visit to the world famous Angkor Wat Cambodia temple. It’s a profound and heavy experience. Exploring Angkor feels a bit like stepping into The Jungle Book. These massive Hindu temple ruins are almost 1,000 years old, and you can tell it. Everywhere you look, the once fantastic buildings have been shaped by time and nature — with broken walls, caved in ceilings, and huge tree roots and jungle foliage slowly consuming the temples.</p></div></div><div class = "blog-item my-2 shadow"><div class = "blog-item-top"><img src = "images/blog-6.jpg" alt = "blog"><span class = "blog-date">oct 28, 2021</span></div><div class = "blog-item-bottom"><span>travel | Bhava</span><a href = "#">43 Best Waterfalls In Bali (+Map)</a><p class = "text">Thanks to the tropical climate and mountains in Bali, there are dozens of natural waterfalls to see on the island, and many of the best ones are easy to reach from popular areas like Ubud.

Either way, all of them are worth seeing.

It’s easy to visit the Phi Phi islands on a day trip (by boat) from Phuket, Krabi, Khao Lak, or Koh Lanta, and that gives you enough time to see Maya Bay and the other main sights, or you can stay a few days on Phi Phi Don and do even more exploring.</p></div></div></div></div></section><footer class = "py-4"><div class = "container footer-row"><div class = "footer-item"><a href = "index.html" class = "site-brand"> Trip<span>Hai!</span></a><p class = "text">Discover the world, one unforgettable journey at a time.Your adventure starts here – explore, dream, and travel beyond limits.</p></div><div class = "footer-item"><h2>Follow us on: </h2><ul class = "social-links"><li><a href = "#"><i class = "fab fa-facebook-f"></i></a></li><li><a href = "#"><i class = "fab fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href = "#"><i class = "fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href = "#"><i class = "fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li><li><a href = "#"><i class = "fab fa-google-plus"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class = "footer-item"><h2>Popular Places:</h2><ul><li><a href = "#">Thailand</a></li><li><a href = "#">Australia</a></li><li><a href = "#">Maldives</a></li><li><a href = "#">Switzerland</a></li><li><a href = "#">Germany</a></li></ul></div><div class = "subscribe-form footer-item"><h2>Subscribe for Newsletter!</h2><form class = "flex"><input type = "email" placeholder="Enter Email" class = "form-control"><input type = "submit" class = "btn" value = "Subscribe"></form></div></div></footer><script src = "js/script.js"></script><script></script></body></html>
